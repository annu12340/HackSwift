## Inspiration

Step into the epic tale of our planet, where a stark inequality commands the spotlight: the unfolding drama of pollution, a pervasive global crisis that casts a formidable shadow across the entire expanse of Earth.

Within this sweeping saga, the ensemble is sharply divided into two distinct roles. On one side stand the culprits—affluent nations draped in their hefty carbon footprints, the ostentatious generators of pollutants. On the opposing front, our unsung heroes—nations grappling with the harsh realities of climate change, burdened by the weight of their circumstances.

The compelling data paints a vivid picture, revealing that the wealthiest 10% of the global population is responsible for nearly 58% of global emissions. Adding a layer of cruelty to this narrative is the fact that the least affluent have contributed minimally to the predicament yet bear the brunt of its impacts most profoundly.

However, do not succumb to despair, for the tale is far from its conclusion. Now is the opportune moment to rewrite the narrative, ushering in the era of ZeroC—a revolutionary approach to flipping the script.

## What it does

In its essence, carbon trading constitutes a system that enables companies to engage in the buying and selling of permits or credits, granting them the right to emit a specific amount of carbon dioxide (CO2).

- Upon integration into the ZeroC platform, each country is endowed with an initial cap of 100 carbon credits. This cap serves as a tangible limit on the permissible emissions for the country within a specified timeframe.
- Companies operating within the ZeroC ecosystem can formally request carbon credits from their respective country's credit pool.
- Subsequently, the environmental authorities of the concerned country meticulously scrutinize the request.
- This scrutiny involves a thorough assessment of the company's emissions data and sustainability initiatives, determining the alignment of the request with overarching climate goals.
- The country retains the discretionary power to either approve or reject the company's credit request.
- In instances where a country confronts a shortage of available carbon credits for allocation, it possesses the flexibility to acquire additional credits from other countries participating in the ZeroC network.
- Conversely, nations endowed with surplus credits can choose to make them available for purchase by others within the network

### Impact of blockchain

ZeroC harnesses the transformative power of blockchain technology to establish a marketplace characterized by transparency, security, and unparalleled efficiency.

- At the core of ZeroC's innovation lies the utilization of blockchain, which furnishes an immutable ledger. This tamper-resistant and transparent ledger serves as a comprehensive record of all transactions within the platform.
- The inherent transparency of the blockchain guarantees a high level of trust in the system, as every transaction is permanently recorded and verifiable by all participants.
- This not only enhances the integrity of the marketplace but also instills confidence in the users, knowing that the information they access is accurate and unalterable.
- Furthermore, ZeroC leverages the cryptographic techniques inherent in blockchain to bolster the security of transactions. These techniques play a pivotal role in safeguarding the privacy and integrity of data exchanged within the platform.

## How we built it

- Backend: Django REST, Swagger
- Frontend: React, Tailwind
- Blockchain: Ganache, Metamask, ether.js

## How the project fits the theme of "Streamlining Solutions for Global Challenges"

 - The ZeroC project aligns closely with the theme of "Streamlining Solutions for Global Challenges" by presenting an innovative approach to addressing the pressing issue of climate change on a global scale.  ZeroC holds the potential to make a significant impact on sustainability by incentivizing responsible carbon emissions practices. In incentivizing sustainable practices and enabling the redistribution of resources, ZeroC becomes a catalyst for positive change, striving towards a future where environmental stewardship is a collective endeavor, transcending borders and promoting a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
    - Data shows that the wealthiest 10% of the global population is responsible for nearly 58% of global emissions. The project acknowledges and seeks to rectify the stark inequality in carbon emissions and promoting equality in the developing and developed countries
    - Furthermore, the emphasis on transparency in scrutinizing carbon credit requests ensures an equitable distribution of environmental responsibilities. The platform's support for technology transfer and capacity building fosters collaboration between nations, promoting equality in addressing climate challenges.

## How ZeroC satisfy the judging criteria
